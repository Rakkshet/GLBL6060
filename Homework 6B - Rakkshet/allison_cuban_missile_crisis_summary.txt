Yo, check the numbers, they keep on comin'
Sorensen and Kennedy, yeah, they be drummin'
Able, missile crisis got the world in a trance
I'm spittin' these facts with precision, no chance

Hilsman and Schlesinger droppin' knowledge too
But I stay true, stickin' with the crew
I'm on a mission, like a lyrical magician
Sorensen, Kennedy, my intuition

I keep it fly, like a missile in the sky
My position clear, no need to ask why
In this debate, I stand tall and free
A third stance, no labels on me

Steinbrunner with the cognitive model
Eminem in the mix, never a muddle
Shoutout to Ernest R. May, for the insight
Deterrence and defense, keepin' it tight

I'm droppin' bombs in every sentence
Eminem, the rap game's relentless
So take a listen, to these lines I present
I'm the rap god, no need to repent
Yo, let me break it down for you in this rap flow,
These references ain't just numbers, they show what we know,
Sorensen and Kennedy, comin' in strong,
In the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis where tensions prolong.

Hilsman and Schlesinger, their words come alive,
Movin' a nation forward, helpin' us strive,
Through research and study, we seek to understand,
The complexities of international relations, ain't that grand?

From bold positions to cognitive models so bright,
We delve into the depths, shedding new light,
Ernest R. May, we salute your expertise,
In this world of research, seeking truths with ease.

Snyder on deterrence and defense, sharing insight,
In this realm of knowledge, we take flight,
So let's keep pushing boundaries, breaking down walls,
In the pursuit of wisdom, answering the calls.
