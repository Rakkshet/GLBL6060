The text discusses a formula for computable numbers with symbols representing different configurations of a machine. It introduces a method involving integers to represent symbols and machine configurations in order to handle the information more easily. The formula is used to describe complete configurations based on scanned symbols and corresponding numbers. The aim is to modify the numerical description to enhance the definition of computable sequences.
